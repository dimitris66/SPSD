SPSD

Main function:
/autofs/cluster/manoach/K24_MEG_EEG_Study/Code/Spindle_Detection_Algorithms/SPSD/ndehghani_detect_spindles.m

It calls:
GioAdaptation/fun_ndehghani_detect_spindles_v1_Test2.m
or
fun_ndehghani_detect_spindles_v1_Nima.m

fun_ndehghani_detect_spindles_v1_Nima.m calls 
Nima's implementation
/autofs/cluster/manoach/K24_MEG_EEG_Study/Code/Spindle_Detection_Algorithms/SPSD/SPSD_tally_GD.m


Make clear why 
fun_ndehghani_detect_spindles_v1_Test2 & 
fun_ndehghani_detect_spindles_v1_Nima
are differrent?*

*Focus on fun_ndehghani_detect_spindles_v1_Nima for now

How the parameters are tuned?
