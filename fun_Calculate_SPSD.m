%% Inputs
% Data: data array (n channels x n timepoints)
% Fs: Sampling Frequency (Hz)
% win: Length of window (samples)
% noverlap: window overlap (samples)
% band: [lowfreq highfreq]

%% Outputs
% SPSD: Power Spectral Density within each window (n channels x n timepoints)

%% Calculate sigma power spectrum
% "Power was calculated in the frequency range of 7â€“15 Hz using windows 500-ms long and
% moving steps of 100 ms"
